# SVM-project
This repository is the final project submission for the ML Fundamentals subject.

The project focuses on the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to various datasets. Initially, an artificial dataset was created, featuring mean, standard deviation, and two output classes. This dataset underwent an 80%-20% split for training and testing, respectively. Through extensive experimentation involving cross-validation, optimal hyperparameters for *C*, *kernel*, and *gamma* were determined. A visual representation of the decision boundary and support vectors was generated to enhance understanding of these concepts.

Subsequently, SVM was applied to a real-world dataset, specifically the pulsar dataset. Prior to modeling, a comprehensive data analysis was conducted, which included assessing the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, and imputing missing values based on statistical measures. The best hyperparameters were then identified using the same methodology as the initial step, culminating in the creation of an SVM classifier.

Finally, the project team selected the South African Heart Disease dataset for further analysis and machine learning application. The outcomes of this analysis are documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.
